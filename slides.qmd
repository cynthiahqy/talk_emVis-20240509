# Overview

## Research (Collaboration) Objectives

***Visualising harmonisation logic:***

- About Me!
- Crossmaps Framework
    - Motivation
    - Contribution
- VIS/CHI Research Opportunities
    - Data provenance semantics
    - Interactive data wrangling
    - Domain applications

::: notes
-   problem set up (borrow Kai's slide)
    - semantics of data preparation -- beyond translating (NLP, glyphs, programming languages)
    - extracting, representing logic of transformations
    - from imperative to declarative specification
-   unified framework
    - dual problems appear when you think about [data imputation model]
        - implementation & validation of logic: sensitivity analysis, statistical properties
        - **communication & visualisation of logic**: code-free implementation interfaces, workflows
-   vis/chi challenges / opportunities
    - extraction of data imputation model (graph computation) from existing scripts
        - track-vec; modifying input rather than diff tracing
    - interactive authoring and modification of data imputation model (i.e. harmonisation logic)
-   domain applications
    -   application 01 --> trade/labour concordance for cross-country comparison
        - xmap workshop paper + sankey layout problem
    -   application 02 --> geographic concordance
        - example from merry; what's the best way to display this information?
    -   application 03 --> causal loop diagrams
        - harmonisation can happen between any sets of "related" objects (i.e. nodes OR links)

# Crossmaps Framework

## Problem Statement & Inspiration

## Solution

## Implications

# VIS/CHI research opportunities

## Visualisation / Communication Design

- relates to semantics side of Data Provenance work
    - hierarchical data provenance
    - nested model
- different approach from existing solutions:
    - smallsets, anteater, COMANTICS etc.

## Interactive Workflow & Validation Tool Design

- relates to verification/tool/interface side of Data Provenance work
    - reproducibility, validation
    - logic modification & extraction

## Domain Applications
